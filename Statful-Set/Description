# 🧠 Headless Service in Kubernetes

## 📘 Overview

In Kubernetes, a **Headless Service** is a type of service that **does not assign a Cluster IP**. Instead of routing traffic through a load balancer, it provides **direct DNS-based access** to the individual **Pod IPs** that match a label selector.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Stateful applications (e.g., **Cassandra**, **MongoDB**, **Kafka**)
- Applications that need **pod identity**
- Systems that implement **client-side load balancing**
- Scenarios where **Pod IPs** must be exposed directly via DNS
